/* A picture of a frame the broker shows (a probe's or a pad script's capture), taken without holding up the present
 * (graphics patch 0025, display.cpp).
 *
 * Before, a present carrying a capture did all of this before it returned: wait for its flip to be shown, read the
 * 1920x1080 frame back from the display's buffer pixel by pixel through the tiling, then write and fsync a 6 MiB PPM.
 * The client's frame stopped 0.63-0.75 s. That happened in all 60 ten-second windows with a capture in a Direct3D 12
 * game's runs, and was taken for the game's own hitch (PS5_Proton docs/PLAN.md; four runs of 2026-10-17, records
 * removed from the tree, in git history).
 *
 * Now the present fills the same frame, pointer included, a second time into tiled memory of its own (8.4 MiB, the
 * display copy's own code). It never reads it back from the display's buffer, which reads at about 105 MB/s: a
 * whole-buffer copy from it still took 80 ms in the present (2026-10-17). It hands that copy to one
 * capture thread (pw_display_capture_take), which writes the PPM as PATH.part, fsyncs it and renames it to PATH. So a
 * reader that finds PATH finds all of it; the title's pad script polls for it.
 *
 * What is written is what the flip shows; the present no longer waits for the flip to be shown. At most PW_DISPLAY_CAPTURE_QUEUE pictures wait, 8.4 MiB each.
 * A further capture waits in the present for the oldest to be written. The caller writes a capture in the present
 * itself, as before, when the memory or the thread cannot be had. pw_display_capture_drain waits for every picture
 * before the display closes.
 *
 * Each written picture is one line in the broker's log:
 * "gpu-display capture flip= copy_us= write_us= status= path=". Host test: tests/test_pw_display_capture.c. */
